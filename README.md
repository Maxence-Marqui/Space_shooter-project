# Spaceshooter_project
Prototype for a small game to get a hang of Python and Pygame.

ZQSD to move
Space bar to shoot

The enemies use trigonometry to always ajust their firing angle and where they are facing at to always be looking at your main ship.
They move following a basic AI that follow a set of coordinates that it must reach checkpoint by checkpoint.
The buttons of the menues are custom made using classes.

I might come back to this project some day for fun
